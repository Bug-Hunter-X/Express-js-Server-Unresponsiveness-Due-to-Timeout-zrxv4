# Node.js Express.js Server Timeout Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express.js servers where a delay in responding to requests can cause problems. The bug is a 5-second timeout in the response handling, making the server appear unresponsive to clients until the timeout expires.  The solution showcases how to address this with appropriate asynchronous handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The server takes 5 seconds to respond to any request because of the `setTimeout` function within the route handler.  This is a problem, as the user might perceive a server error or timeout.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code, demonstrating a more efficient approach to handling asynchronous operations that does not block the main thread and provide better response to the clients.
